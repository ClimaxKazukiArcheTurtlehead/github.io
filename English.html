					While aiming for future professional contracts, centering on affiliated clubs, we will discover training-type semi-professional contract players or scholarship system players from the age of 16, and develop and produce human resources who can aim for first-class athletes and members of society. I will aim for. From 2016, in the reality that "athletes have difficulty in forming a career after finishing their competitive life", Climax Lazuki | Arche Turtlehead e-sports Gaming and AIKO Gaming will focus on events such as Clash Royale, BowlStars, and Quick Push Quiz. We have continued to improve the working environment for full-time employees so that athletes can balance competition and work. This system (semi-professional contract / scholarship system) provides true literary and martial arts professional athletes who can play an active role as members of society by experiencing the responsibility for the rewards obtained as professionals for young athletes who are aiming to become top athletes. The purpose is to grow. Within three years, we aim to hire a total of about 200 semi-professional contract athletes, and aim to produce athletes who can aim for first-class in both Bunbu and Budo.

						I sometimes say that
In this era, the hurdles for the most professional and semi-professional activities in human history are lowering.
(I'm not saying that you can easily get rich)<br>
<br>
<br>
That genre is<br>
Even with magic<br>
Even juggling<br>
Even in performance<br>
Even if you eat ramen<br>
Anything, really anything can be a job.<br>
<br>
I need a little trick, though.<br>
No one will tell you the trick, so I'm sure everyone<br>
I wonder if I think "I can't do it".<br>
<br>
100 million total creators,<br>
100 million total producer era.<br>
Now both professionals and amateurs are in the same spot.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter if you have the technology or not.<br>
<br>
Even if you say various things, it's difficult to step forward in reality.<br>
Lots of things I don't understand.<br>
<br>
An era where both professionals and amateurs are at the same point?<br>
Total creator era?<br>
Doesn't it matter if you don't have the technology?<br>
Does one favorite become every job / activity?<br>
What kind of life do you have in the first place?<br>
Next-generation way of life? How to work?<br>
I hope it helps you find them.<br>
